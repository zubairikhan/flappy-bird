# flappy-bird
Flappy Bird on Unity with C#. Assignment for the course Mathematics for Games Spring 2019

This was the first assignment we were given in the course. It was useful in getting familiar with frequently used Unity constructs. However, we were instructed not to use Unity's in-game physics engine and were instead required to code the maths and physics(gravity, bird flapping etc) ourselves.

Enjoyed a lot making this game that I loved playing some 6-7 years ago!
